The artwork and edge correction properties of an autotile can be modified using the
tileset designer. Changes will be applied to previously painted tiles.


## Context

The generated atlas texture will be overwritten if autotile atlas is regenerated. You
should retain a backup of any modifications that you have made to the atlas texture just
in case you accidentally lose them.



## Steps

1. Select tileset using **Brush** palette and select menu command
   **![tileset context menu](../img/context-button.png) | Show in Designer...**.


2. Select **Modify Autotile** tab.


3. Adjust autotile artwork and other properties as needed.


4. Click **Apply Changes**.
