![](../img/tool/tool-cycle.png) Cycle through available variations of a tile or plop that
has already been painted.

Oriented brushes allow you to provide multiple variations which can be randomly chosen
whilst painting. This tool allows you to manually cycle through available variations
allowing you to pick the one that you want.

- **Left Click** - Cycle to previous variation.

- **Right Click** - Cycle to next variation.



## Advanced Options

Can cycle plops
: Indicates whether plops can be cycled when using cycle tool. Deselect this option when
  plops are stealing input focus from tile system making it difficult to cycle regular
  tiles.

Interact with active system only
: Indicates whether cycle tool should only be able to interact with plops that are
  associated with the active tile system.
