Presets make it easy to reuse parameters that are commonly used when creating tile systems.
Saved presets can be accessed from the **Preset** popup field.

>
> **Tip** - Tile system presets are created into the "Assets/Plugins/PackageData/@rotorz/unity3d-tile-system/Presets"
> directory within your project and can be exported to other projects if needed.
