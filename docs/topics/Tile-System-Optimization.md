Various options are provided allowing you to strip unwanted aspects from the tile systems
in your projects. You can also combine tile meshes by material on a per chunk basis to
reduce the number of draw calls which can be particularly beneficial when targeting mobile
platforms.

Benefits of tile system optimization:

- Vertices of static tiles automatically snapped within user defined threshold.

- Smoothing of normals at tile joins.

- Removal of unwanted tile data and tile system components.

- Static tiles can be combined often resulting with fewer draw calls.
