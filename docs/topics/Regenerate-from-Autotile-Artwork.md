An autotile atlas can be regenerated to reflect changes that have been made to the input
artwork. Previously painted tiles will be updated automatically to reflect such changes.


## Context

The generated atlas texture will be overwritten if autotile atlas is regenerated. You
should retain a backup of any modifications that you have made to the atlas texture just
in case you accidentally lose them.



## Steps

1. Select tileset using **Brush** palette and select menu command
   **![tileset context menu](../img/context-button.png) | Show in Designer...**.


2. Select **Modify Autotile** tab.
