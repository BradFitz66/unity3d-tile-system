Some brush properties are applied when painting tiles. Changes to such properties will
have no immediate effect on previously painted tiles.


## Symptoms

Previously painted tiles do not reflect changes that have been made to one or more brushes.



## Resolve

Refresh affected tile system(s) to repaint all existing tiles using the updated brush.
