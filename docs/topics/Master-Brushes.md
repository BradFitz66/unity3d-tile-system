Master brushes are normal brushes except they cannot be edited using designer without
first moving them into the "TileBrushes" folder in your project. The purpose of master
brushes is to define reusable templates which cannot be inadvertently modified.

For example, the provided "Smooth Platform" master brushes can be reused by creating new
alias brushes like the "Grass" and "Cave" ones provided. Master brushes can be duplicated
when greater control is needed (i.e. to add/remove orientations and variations).
