The runtime API allows you to access, paint and erase tiles at runtime using brushes. This
can be useful when developing custom tile-based character controllers, level designers, etc.

Here are some of the capabilities of the runtime API:

- Paint and erase tiles using brushes.

- Calculate tile index using ray tracing.

- Find tile nearest given world position.

- Access tile data by row and column indices.

- Use tile data to assist with game logic (orientation, variation index, flags).

- Postpone and control generation of procedural meshes.

For further information please take a look at the API reference.
