The materials of painted tiles can be remapped making it possible to reuse existing
brushes but with different materials. This can be a massive time saver when working with
oriented brushes.

Whilst the concept of remapping materials can be applied to other brush types, it is most
applicable for alias brushes. In fact remapping materials is one of the primary purposes
of alias brushes. Multiple mappings can be specified for brushes that refer to objects
that use multiple materials.

The image below illustrates how the default material of the "Smooth Platform" brush can be
remapped to "Grass Stone" in the "Grass Block" alias brush. The same "Smooth Platform"
master brush can also be remapped to other materials (like "Cave" for example).
