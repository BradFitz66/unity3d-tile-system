Tilesets are created using the **Create Brush / Tileset** window which can then be managed
using the tileset designer. Tileset brushes can then be created using the tileset designer.

You may find it beneficial to place fully opaque tiles into a separate tileset from those
that contain transparency to avoid alpha blending where possible. Alpha blending can be a
costly process, especially for mobile platforms.
